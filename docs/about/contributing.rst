.. _pull requests: https://github.com/morian/aio-ld2410/compare/

I am especially interested in feedbacks on variants and firmwares behaviors, especially
if we can find a reliable way to detect the type of variant this library is discussing with.

Also, writing documentation is not my favorite cup of tea, all improvements are welcome!


Questions
---------

I opened the `discussion area`_ on github for any question and discussion that cannot fit
in a bug report. Please use this space for anything related to this library.

This place is not suitable in the following situations:

- A question about :mod:`asyncio` and how to do things with it
- A question that is already answered in this documentation or in the discussion space
