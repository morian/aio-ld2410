``aio-ld2410`` is a python library that allows interacting with the `Hi-Link LD2410`_ sensors
using asyncio_.

.. _Hi-Link LD2410: https://hlktech.net/index.php?id=988
.. _asyncio: https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html

Such radar sensor would typically require an USB-UART adapter on most computers but is
natively included on most embedded platforms such as the `Raspberry Pi`_.

This library supports a wide range of variants in terms of models and firmware versions,
but was mostly tested on LD2410C_ with firmware ``v2.04.23022511``.

It features comprehensible methods to get and set various configuration parameters,
as well as dataclasses_ for output results and sensor reports.

Installation
------------

This package requires Python â‰¥ 3.9 and pulls a few other packages as dependencies.

To install ``aio-ld2410``, simply run the following command:

.. code-block:: console

    python -m pip install aio-ld2410


Usage
-----

Here's how you can start reading sensor reports from a few lines of python:

.. code-block:: python

   #!/usr/bin/env python

   import asyncio
   from aio_ld2410 import LD2410

   async def main():
       async with LD2410('/dev/ttyUSB0') as device:
           async with device.configure():
               ver = await device.get_firmware_version()
               print(f'[+] Running with firmware v{ver}')

           # Reports are typically generated every 100ms.
           async for report in device.get_reports():
               print(report)

   asyncio.run(main())
